If model is exploded fully to deepest level,
Harry Potter effect occurs. Also, the gfx BRRES created afterwards
is unreadable by BrawlBox for Harry Potter effect fix.

Workaround:
*Remove VRCorn group, and offest angle group
*Explode main course group.
*Remove all ref lines for paths
*DO NOT explode Decor groupings! This prevents Harry Potter effect
