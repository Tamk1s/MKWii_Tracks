Using irfanview, batch vflip all png images in Textures folder, so that they are upside down, and resave as png
I save my batch converted images at C:\Temp2\ usually.

Run RepText.bat to copy all vflip'd images from C:\Temp2 to Textures folder, and copy the transparent pngs (already vflip'd+transparency) at this folder into there.

For applying mipmaps, read note in "Mipmap" folder
