This folder is used for generating the track's KCL.

How to handle it:

1. Export KCL collision model to obj/mtl model pair
2. If creating KCL for first time, run "kcl_cff.bat" to autogenerate .flag file.

3. Modify .flag file as appropriate for KCL flags (most textures are named indicating main collision flag used)

4. Run "kcl_make.bat" . This will convert the .flag file into course.kcl

5. Run "kcl_fix.bat" . This will run unbeancorner.exe and patch beancorners

   PLEASE create file symlink for unbeancorner.exe into "C:\Windows" to use from command prompt!
   Patched KCL file will be named new-course.kcl; this is the file that will be used for the track payload
