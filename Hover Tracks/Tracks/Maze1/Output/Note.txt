KMP notes:

For enemy routes, I use Battle Course styled dispatch points with auto-routing
(http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Creating_enemy_routes_of_battle_arenas_with_Wiimm%27s_tools#Edit_the_ENPT_section)

In KMP Cloud for course.kmp, click "Enemy Routes", and then set stuff as follows:

Dispatch Points:
*Last1-Last6 = $FF
*Next1=$00, Next2-Next6=$FF

All other non-dispatch routes:
*Last1=$00, Last2-Last6=$FF
*Next1=$00, Next2-Next6=$FF


To complete auto-routing from course.kmp:
1. Run "Extract.bat". This will convert "course.kmp" into a txt representation, into "orig.kmp.txt" and "new.kmp.txt"
2. Do the steps in the above WIKI link in "new.kmp.txt", and save. Pay attention to notes in "1WayNote.txt" files! This indicates which routes are 1-way (if any)
3. Run "Compile.bat". This will convert "new.kmp.txt" (with auto-routing now complete) into "new-course.kmp". This file will be used for the new tracks
4. Run "Verify.bat". This will convert "new-course.kmp" into a 3D OBJ/MTL pair (verify.obj/.mlt) model. Load this in a Google Sketchup to verify the route paths.
