1. Place original copy of [ISO ROOT]/Race/Common.szs into "Source" folder
2. Run "Extract.bat" to extract contents of original Common.szs into "Input"
3. Run "Make.bat" to copy modified models/assets into extracted Common archive. Will run "Compress.bat" to compress new archive into "Output" folder

"Models" Folder contains Input, Output, and Source folder similarly for each model's brres. No batch files used for individual models; I generate those by-hand with the assets available. (To be refactored later)
After making changes to an asset, re-run steps 2 and 3 to recompile
