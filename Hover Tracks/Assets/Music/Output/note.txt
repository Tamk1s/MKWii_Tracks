All brstrm files are named appropriately here, except:

"Break.brstm"			- Arena Rumble song
"Break_F.brstm"			- Arena Rumble song (Fast)
"level1_final.brstm"		- Hover Maze 1 Song
"level1_final_f.brstm"		- Hover Maze 1 Song (Fast)
"level2_final.brstm"		- Hover Maze 2 Song
"level2_final_f.brstm"		- Hover Maze 2 Song (Fast)
"level3_final.brstm"		- Hover Maze 3 Song
"level3_final_f.brstm"		- Hover Maze 3 Song (Fast)
"Windows_95_SQUAR_Remix.brstm"	- Hover Credits songs
"Windows_95_SQUAR_RemixF.brstm"	- Hover Credits songs (Fast)

These are renamed appropriately by "Hover Tracks\Payload\Make.bat" script
(This was done in case the level slots get reordered)

The original BRSAR in Source folder needs patched against these BRSTRM files,
so that the lengths are appropriate in-game, and then placed in Output folder
(use http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Patch_that_BRSAR!)

The BRSAR in this Output folder has already been pre-patched for the BRSTRM lengths, and new sfx

See "Input\Sfx" folder for input sound effects/jingles (not BRSTM based)
in format of XX_YY, where XX is the GRP ID, and YY is the SFX ID
