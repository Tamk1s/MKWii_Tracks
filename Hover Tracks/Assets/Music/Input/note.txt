The following files/subfolders should be ready-to-use WAV files to import into the BRSAR for sfx/jingles, or for WAV music to BRSTM. Both can be down with BrawlBox.

Some of the subfolders include AUP files, which are Audacity project files.
Most WAV files are named after the BRSTM song they will replace, or the Group ID/SFX ID pair for sfx

Some folders have more notes, please read them
