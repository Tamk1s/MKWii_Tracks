This folder contains the source files for creating the battle_cup_select.thp replacement file.

Input folder has subfolders for each track
(Maze 1, 2, 3, Small, Extra, and the entirety of Wii Battle Cup)

Folders:
"Input\Dummy"
"Input\Extra"
"Input\Maze1"
"Input\Maze2"
"Input\Maze3"
"Input\Small"
"Input\Wii"

"Dummy' folder contains each padding frames for the video.

Each other input folder has an input mp4 file, an output mp4 file, and a PowerDirector 11 PDS file. The PDS file was used to trim and render the video to proper spec for the THP.
The "output" folder contains the new THP file, and "make.bat" . Run that batch script to copy over the input files, rename them proper for usage with Thwimp, and then run Thwimp to encode a new video
