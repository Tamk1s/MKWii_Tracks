This folder contains the source files for creating the battle_retro.thp replacement file.

Input folder has subfolders for each track (Maze 1, 2, 3, Small, Extra)

Folders:
"Input\Dummy"
"Input\Extra"
"Input\Maze1"
"Input\Maze2"
"Input\Maze3"
"Input\Small"

"Dummy" folder contains each padding frames for the video, and a dummy video for cell A3_1.

Each other input folder has an MPEG video (original recording from Wii hardware), and input mp4 file, an output mp4 file, and a PowerDirector 11 PDS file.
The PDS file was used to trim and render the video to proper spec for the THP.

The "output" folder contains the new THP file, and "make.bat" . Run that batch script to copy over the input ([Course]Output.mp4) files, rename them properly for usage with Thwimp, and then run Thwimp to encode a new video
