This folder is a mess and input videos created manually for the most part! It needs refactored.

Title folder is for the 4 title videos
(SD NTSC/PAL, and 16:9 NTSC/PAL).

Each video is unique

Folder/file breakdown:

"Input\" - Input files

"Input\200bttrf.avi"	- Source video for title.thp (16:9 NTSC)
"Input\WELCOME1.AVI"	- Source video for title_50.thp (16:9 PAL)
"Input\WELCOME2.AVI"	- Source video for title_SD_50.thp (4:3 PAL)
"Input\WELCOME3.AVI"	- Source video for title_SD.thp (4:3 NTSC)

All of these videos are too short to fit in the exact frame count of 4250 frames for the title videos (70.9 seconds long (about 1 minute, 11 seconds)), so they have been extended with a still frame (all videos except 200bttrf.avi)

Welcome3 loops a few frames for the cloud animation, with wind sound effect

Extension folders for each video (Welcome N)
"Input\w1ext"
"Input\w2ext"
"Input\w3ext"

Output folder has the proper input filenames for usage with Thwimp
