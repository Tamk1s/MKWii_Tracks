This folder contains the source files used for creating the new THP videos.

The source files are meant to be used with my own Thwimp utility, which was designed in parallel with this project. (http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Thwimp)

Folder breakdown is the same as the THP root folder on the MKWii DVD, (http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Filesystem/thp) just only the files/folders we need to modify

Folder breakdown:
"battle"	- "/thp/battle" on DVD
"title"		- "/thp/title" on DVD
"Thwimp"	- Place Thwimp here to use it from the make.bat batch scripts for THP re-encoding
