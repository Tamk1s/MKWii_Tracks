This folder is the "Payload" folder.
It compiles the tracks and entire project into "Output", and will send the entire project into the "My Stuff" folders of CTGP-R and OptPack

The following assets should already be pre-compiled in the other folders, before compiling the tracks/entire pack:

1. "Hover Tracks\Assets\Msgs"		- Game textures, bootstrap, updated messages
2. "Hover Tracks\Assets\Models\Common"	- Hover Item Pack
3. "Hover Tracks\Assets\Models\localcop"- Master copies of local level assets (new coins, new itemboxes)
4. "Hover Tracks\Assets\Music"		- BRSAR, and the new BRSTRM music 
5. "Hover Tracks\Assets\Videos"		- New THP videos
6. "Hover Tracks\Tracks\"		- The compiled track assets (Course, Minimap, VRCorn graphics brres archives; KCL collision, KMP objpos)


How to compile tracks/project:

1. Goto "Source" folder, extract original szs track archives here (see note in folder)
2. Run "Extract.bat". This will extract the original track archives into "Input" folder
3. Run "Make.bat" . This will run:
4. "Track.bat" . This will copy the modified track assets (Course, Minimap, and VRCorn graphics brres archives; KCL collision, KMP objpos) into the "Input" folders, as well as the local copies of modified coins and itembox models
5. "Compress.bat" . This will compress the modified track archives, and place them into "Output" folder, as well as duplicate the files into "_d" 2P copies
6. "Music.bat" . This will copy the BRSAR and BRSTRM music files from "Hover Tracks\Assets\Music" folder intto "Output" folder
7. "Msg.bat" . This will copy all of the modified szs archives in "Hover Tracks\Assets\Msgs" into Output (new game graphics, updated BMG text files, bootstrap), as well as Common.szs (Hover Item Pack)
8. "Output\send.bat" . This will send all of the files from above now in "Output" folder to your SD Card's "My Stuff" folders (CTGP-R, OptPack)

Re-run steps 2-3 everytime you modify the tracks, for fast, iterative testing of tracks.
